<h1>CUB3D WORLD</h1>
<br>
<p>Here are the functions where the map is parsed into the members of t_scene instance (in the future it will be called t_world). The setters receive the line and the t_scene instance to make any needed process inside them, so no one of such functions return something.</p>
<p>The validation of the data read from the cub file is handled by "world/error" functions.</p>
