# CUB3D

This project was initially developed in 2021, when the basic project had to
include sprites. This is not the version submitted, and contain some problems.

Also it was corrected to build on Debian 12, without following 42 norms. If you
are a student, you might find some help in this code, but i also recomend other
projects that helped me in the past:
